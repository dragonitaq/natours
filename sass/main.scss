/* Notice there is no underscore & file extension needed to locate the base file because SASS understands it. Using and underscore "_"  before sass files lets the sass compiler know that we are working with partial files.  When partials are processed, the compiler knows not to create a separate stylesheet for them.
Keep in mind that @import will be phased out in the future and will be replace by @use. But isn't supported yet when using node-sass. When it is supported, we should change to @use. */

/* Shorthand to importing all files in Sass folders with @import */
// @import "base/*"     // import all the files in the base folder.
// @import "base/**/*"  // import all the files in the base tree, like subfolders and files.
